Fancy Tasks NG is a feature-rich, highly customizable taskbar-style window switcher for KDE Plasma. It brings modern aesthetics, improved animations, and deep configuration options to your desktop.

## Why this fork?

This project is a modern continuation of the Fancy Tasks plasmoid. 
It started as a fork of [FancyTasksPlus](https://github.com/SushiTrashXD/FancyTasksPlus) by SushiTrashXD, which in turn was a fork of the original [FancyTasks](https://github.com/alexankitty/FancyTasks) by alexankitty (with additional code from Luis Bocanegra).

The primary reason for creating this fork is that both the original repository and its subsequent forks have long been abandoned. They lack support for modern versions of KDE Plasma and contained numerous bugs that broke the experience on newer systems. Fancy Tasks NG breathes new life into the project by ensuring compatibility and introducing several major improvements.

## Features & Improvements

Compared to the previous versions, Fancy Tasks NG includes the following major changes:

- **Full Modern Plasma 6.5+ Compatibility**: Fully adapted for the latest KDE Plasma.
- **Russian Localization**: Full translation of the plasmoid interface and settings into Russian.
- **Reworked Tooltip System**: Completely redesigned, unified, smooth-morphing tooltips native to Plasma 6.
- **Reworked Pinned Apps Manager**: A fully redesigned interface for managing and rearranging pinned applications in the settings.
- **Hover Zoom Fixes**: Corrected and improved the icon scaling (zoom) mechanism on hover.
- **Zoom Rendering Fixes**: Fixed the display mechanism for scaled icons to eliminate visual artifacts.
- **Numerous Bug Fixes**: A huge amount of under-the-hood fixes and optimizations for a smoother experience.

*Additionally, it retains all the great features from previous versions:*
- Custom Indicators: Various styles of indicators (Dashes, Dots, Metro, Ciliora, etc.) with customizable colors.
- Animation Enhancements: Smooth transitions, growing/shrinking indicators, and desaturation of minimized tasks.
- Smart Launcher Badges: Support for unread message counts on supported application icons (e.g., KMail).
